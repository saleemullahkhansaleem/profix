      <h2>Introduction to Trading</h2>
      <p>Trading is the act of buying and selling financial instruments such as stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies, and derivatives. The goal is to make a profit from the price movements of these assets.</p>

      <h3>What is Trading?</h3>
      <p>Trading involves speculating on the price movements of financial assets. Unlike investing, which typically involves buying and holding assets for the long term, trading focuses on short-term price movements.</p>

      <h3>Types of Trading</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Day Trading:</strong> Buying and selling within the same day</li>
        <li><strong>Swing Trading:</strong> Holding positions for several days to weeks</li>
        <li><strong>Position Trading:</strong> Holding positions for weeks to months</li>
        <li><strong>Scalping:</strong> Making many small trades for small profits</li>

      <h3>Growth Model Components</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consistent Risk:</strong> Risk the same percentage of capital on each trade</li>
        <li><strong>Profit Reinvestment:</strong> Reinvest profits to compound growth</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Tracking:</strong> Monitor and analyze results</li>
        <li><strong>Continuous Improvement:</strong> Learn from wins and losses</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Risk-Adjusted Returns</h3>
      <p>Focus on risk-adjusted returns rather than absolute returns. A strategy with 10% return and 5% risk is better than 20% return with 15% risk.</p>
