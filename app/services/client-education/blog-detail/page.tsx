                  There are various assets that traders can choose to add to
                  their portfolio. Financial assets are classified into
                  different broad categories that have varied characteristics.
                  Forex, shares, commodities and cryptocurrencies are examples
                  of groups of financial assets.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Because of their different characteristics, different assets
                  require specialised strategies, analysis tools and risk
                  management. For example, cryptocurrencies are known to have
                  higher volatility than major currency pairs, hence a more
                  robust risk management is recommended for crypto traders.

                  Creating a specialised trading approach for specific assets
                  helps a trader develop expertise in a particular sector,
                  improving their chances to build long-term success in trading.
                  It's also important to understand the factors that influence
                  changes in value for the chosen type of asset. This article

                  largest volumes globally, with over 6.5 trillion US dollars

                  Currencies are divided into major, minor, and exotic pairs.
                  The spreads and liquidity vary between these categories. The

                  reports, and sentiment analysis.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Technical analysis is very commonly used by forex traders with

                  Currency trading is highly leveraged, making the level of risk

                  high impact economic reports releases, affecting the
                  respective countries for specific currencies.

                  Traders should use basic and advanced risk management

                  reasonable risk-reward ratio with a low-risk amount and
                  observing appropriate position size to reduce risk exposure.
                  Long-term forex traders also use hedging to limit risk

                  Physical goods like gold, oil and agricultural products are
                  called commodities. Commodities trading allows market
                  participants to speculate on the price movements of these
                  products without owning the physical assets.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Commodity markets and their value are mostly influenced by
                  supply and demand dynamics, weather conditions and
                  geopolitical events. For example, the industrial metals are
                  affected by increased demand for industrial use in production
                  of durable goods.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Traders in the online commodity markets usually speculate on
                  the prices either to chase profit opportunities, hedge against
                  price risk or diversify their portfolio. Traders can combine
                  fundamental, technical and sentiment analysis tools to
                  identify price trends, potential reversal points and
                  overbought and oversold conditions.

                  Hedging strategy helps traders to cover for losses when prices
                  are adversely changing against their commodity positions.
                  Futures and options contracts are often used by traders
                  choosing this strategy.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  As commodities are highly impacted by supply and demand, it’s
                  important for traders to understand these concepts and use
                  several analysis tools and approaches to identify trade
                  opportunities. Economic calendars are useful tools for
                  commodity traders as reports related to production and
                  consumption can provide useful insights.

                  Commodities have low correlation with the stock markets and
                  fixed income securities, making them a good option for
                  portfolio diversification. Trader mostly turns to commodities
                  during times of high volatility and instability in the forex
                  and stock markets.

                  traders should use risk management strategies, such as

                  Value investing involves selecting stocks or other assets that
                  appear to be trading at a price below their intrinsic value.
                  The premise of value investing is based on the belief that
                  markets can sometimes misprice assets, leading to
                  opportunities for investors to buy undervalued securities and
                  potentially profit as their prices move closer to their
                  intrinsic value over time.

                  or market share. Unlike value investing, which seeks
                  undervalued assets, growth investing prioritises companies
                  with promising prospects for expansion and increasing
                  profitability, even if their current stock prices may seem
                  relatively high compared to traditional valuation metrics.

                  Momentum trading is a strategy that involves trading assets
                  that have demonstrated strong recent performance and selling

                  expectation that the trend will continue in the short to
                  medium term. This strategy is based on the belief that assets
                  that have been performing well are more likely to continue
                  performing well, and vice versa.

                  Trading strategies for crypto can be day trading to investing
                  depending on the trader’s choice. Popular crypto trading
                  strategies include short-term approaches like day and swing
                  trading and scalping. However, some traders can choose to hold
                  their crypto positions long-term, regardless of market
                  volatility.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  News trading is also a popular strategy as crypto prices are
                  highly sensitive to news, regulatory updates and market
                  sentiment. Traders using news trading typically open positions
                  either when the news has been released or just before if they
                  are confident in predicting the outcome. Using fundamental and
                  sentiment analysis can help traders to plan their positions
                  and risk management.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Crypto traders also rely on technical indicators and price
                  charts.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  With crypto trading, it’s important to highlight the element
                  of risk because of, for example high volatility and uncertain
                  regulatory framework. Therefore, it’s important for crypto
                  traders to always use risk management and choose advanced
                  strategies and tools to protect their capital against
                  significant losses.
                </p>
                <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                  Stop loss orders are valuable tools for crypto traders as they
                  instruct the broker to automatically close a position that
                  takes an unfavourable move. Crypto traders should also
                  consider diversifying their portfolio, including also products
                  from other asset classes that tend to involve less risk.
